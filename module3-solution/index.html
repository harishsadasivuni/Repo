Hens (female chickens) often live in groups and each hen looks after her own brood (family of chicks), sometimes living in little houses called chicken coops. Chickens have a “pecking order.” This means that some chickens will rule over others and be the first to get food and have the first choice in nests. A ”battery hen” is one that is kept in a small cage in an industrial farm. Other hens are kept “free range,” where they have more space to move around.Chickens are the most common birds on earth.
